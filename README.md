# Weeb Mania 

Weeb Mania is a rhythm game for Pc and Android. It has primarily famous anime songs ( free midi versions ). In this game,  you'll need to react fast as the notes keep hitting  you quickly. So will you be able to complete all the songs?

I developed this game using Unity for about 6 months. It has been a great learning experience.
